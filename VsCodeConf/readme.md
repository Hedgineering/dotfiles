=======================
Neovim rec from Ty Overby https://github.com/tyoverby/nvim/tree/minimal

Remember to go to vscode keyboard shortcuts and unbind ctrl-n create new untitled text file and remap toggle terminal to ctrl-shift-j instead of ctrl-`

I copied the settings.json here from my ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

To repeat:
```bash
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

cp settings.json ~/.config/VsCodeConf
```
